## Overview

F-UJI is a web service to programmatically assess FAIRness of research data objects based on [metrics](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3775793) developed by the [FAIRsFAIR](https://www.fairsfair.eu/) project.
The service will be applied to demonstrate the evaluation of objects in repositories selected for in-depth collaboration with the project.

The '__F__' stands for FAIR (of course) and '__UJI__' means 'Test' in Malay. So __F-UJI__ is a FAIR testing tool.

### Clients and User Interface

A web demo using F-UJI is available at <https://www.f-uji.net>.

An R client package that was generated from the F-UJI OpenAPI definition is available from <https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/rfuji>.

An open source web client for F-UJI is available at <https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/fairificator>.

## Assessment Scope, Constraint and Limitation
The service is **in development** and its assessment depends on several factors.
- In the FAIR ecosystem, FAIR assessment must go beyond the object itself. FAIR enabling services and repositories are vital to ensure that research data objects remain FAIR over time. Importantly, machine-readable services (e.g., registries) and documents (e.g., policies) are required to enable automated tests.
- In addition to repository and services requirements, automated testing depends on clear machine assessable criteria. Some aspects (rich, plurality, accurate, relevant) specified in FAIR principles still require human mediation and interpretation.
- The tests must focus on generally applicable data/metadata characteristics until domain/community-driven criteria have been agreed (e.g., appropriate schemas and required elements for usage/access control, etc.). For example, for some metrics (i.e., on I and R principles), the automated tests we proposed only inspect the ‘surface’ of criteria to be evaluated. Therefore, tests are designed in consideration of generic cross-domain metadata standards such as Dublin Core, DCAT, DataCite, schema.org, etc.
- FAIR assessment is performed based on aggregated metadata; this includes metadata embedded in the data (landing) page, metadata retrieved from a PID provider (e.g., DataCite content negotiation) and other services (e.g., re3data).

## Requirements
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `3.11+`

### Google Dataset Search
* Download the latest Dataset Search corpus file from: <https://www.kaggle.com/googleai/dataset-search-metadata-for-datasets>
* Open file `fuji_server/helper/create_google_cache_db.py` and set variable 'google_file_location' according to the file location of the corpus file
* Run `create_google_cache_db.py` which creates a SQLite database in the data directory. From root directory run `python3 -m fuji_server.helper.create_google_cache_db`.

The service was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
The service uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/spec-first/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Usage
Before running the service, please set user details in the configuration file, see config/users.py.

To install F-UJI, you may execute the following Python-based or docker-based installation commands from the root directory:

### Python module-based installation

From the fuji source folder run
```bash
python -m pip install .
```
The F-UJI server can now be started with:
```bash
python -m fuji_server -c fuji_server/config/server.ini
```

### Docker-based installation

```bash
docker run -d -p 1071:1071 ghcr.io/pangaea-data-publisher/fuji
```

To access the Swagger user interface, open the URL below in the browser:

<http://localhost:1071/fuji/api/v1/ui/>


Your Swagger definition lives here:

<http://localhost:1071/fuji/api/v1/swagger.json>

You can provide a different server config file this way:

```bash
docker run -d -p 1071:1071 -v server.ini:/usr/src/app/fuji_server/config/server.ini ghcr.io/pangaea-data-publisher/fuji
```

You can also build the docker image from the source code:

```bash
docker build -t <tag_name> .
docker run -d -p 1071:1071 <tag_name>
```

### Notes

To avoid Tika startup warning message, set environment variable `TIKA_LOG_PATH`. For more information, see [https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python](https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python)

If you receive the exception `urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]` on macOS, run the install command shipped with Python:
`./Install\ Certificates.command`.

F-UJI is using [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), so username and password have to be provided for each REST call which can be configured in `fuji_server/config/users.py`.
